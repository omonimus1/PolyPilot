# Performance Optimization

## Critical Invariants

### PERF-1: _sessionSwitching flag lifecycle
`_sessionSwitching` MUST stay `true` until `SafeRefreshAsync` reads it.
`RefreshState()` must NOT clear it — only `SafeRefreshAsync` clears it after
using it to skip the expensive JS draft capture round-trip.

**Impact:** Session switch went from 729–4027ms → 16–28ms when fixed.

**What happens if violated:** Every session switch triggers a JS interop call
to query all card inputs, capture draft text, focus state, and cursor position.
With 3+ sessions this adds 500-2000ms of blocking JS round-trip per switch.

### PERF-2: Never call LoadPersistedSessions() from hot paths
`LoadPersistedSessions()` → `GetPersistedSessions()` scans ALL session
directories (753+ in production). Each directory requires reading `workspace.yaml`
and `events.jsonl` headers.

**Safe callers:** `OnInitialized()`, `TogglePersistedSessions()` (on open),
and error recovery in `HandleResumeSession()`.

**Forbidden callers:** `RefreshSessions()`, `OnStateChanged` handlers, any
code triggered by render cycles.

### PERF-3: Debounce timers must flush in DisposeAsync
Three debounced save operations coalesce rapid-fire calls:
| Operation | Timer | File |
|-----------|-------|------|
| `SaveActiveSessionsToDisk()` | 2s | `CopilotService.Persistence.cs` |
| `SaveOrganization()` | 2s | `CopilotService.Organization.cs` |
| `SaveUiState()` | 1s | `CopilotService.Persistence.cs` |

`DisposeAsync` calls `FlushSaveActiveSessionsToDisk()` and
`FlushSaveOrganization()`. If you add a new debounced save, add a flush call.

### PERF-4: GetOrganizedSessions() cache invalidation
Cached with a composite hash key that includes session count, group count,
sort mode, and per-session processing state. The cache auto-invalidates when
any of these change. Do NOT add high-frequency fields (e.g., streaming content)
to the hash key — it would defeat the cache.

### PERF-5: ReconcileOrganization() skip guard
Skips work when the active session set is unchanged (hash of session names).
If you add new session types or visibility rules, ensure the hash accounts
for them or reconciliation may be incorrectly skipped.

### PERF-6: ReconcileOrganization() during IsRestoring window
`ReconcileOrganization` is skipped during `IsRestoring=true` to prevent pruning
sessions not yet loaded. But code that needs metadata during restore (e.g.,
`CompleteResponse` queue drain, `GetOrchestratorGroupId`, `IsSessionInMultiAgentGroup`)
must call `ReconcileOrganization(allowPruning: false)` to trigger an additive-only
update. This mode adds missing `SessionMeta` entries but never deletes anything.

**Impact:** Without this, multi-agent dispatch is silently bypassed after relaunch,
and the watchdog uses the wrong timeout tier (120s instead of 600s), killing workers.
See PR #284 and processing-state-safety INV-9.

## Caching Architecture

### Markdown Cache (`ChatMessageList.razor`)
- Key: string content (NOT `GetHashCode()` — had collision risk)
- LRU eviction at 1000 entries via `LinkedList<string>` tracking
- Static/shared across all sessions — deduplicates identical content
- `FileToDataUri()` runs synchronously for image paths in markdown

### GetOrganizedSessions() Cache (`CopilotService.Organization.cs`)
- Returns `IReadOnlyList<(SessionGroup, List<AgentSessionInfo>)>`
- Callers should NOT call `.ToList()` on the result (it's already materialized)
- Hash key: `HashCode.Combine(sessionCount, groupCount, sortMode, perSessionState)`

## Known Optimization Opportunities (Not Yet Implemented)

### GetAllSessions().ToList() — called 8+ times per render
Each call snapshots `ConcurrentDictionary` into a new `List`. A per-render
cached snapshot would reduce allocations but current perf is acceptable.

### No Virtualize component for chat messages
Manual windowing via `GetWindowedMessages()` at 25 messages (expanded) or
10 messages (card). Blazor `<Virtualize>` would help but requires fixed
item heights — chat messages have variable height from markdown rendering.

### ChatMessageItem has no ShouldRender()
Always re-renders when parent calls `StateHasChanged()`. Adding a content
hash comparison would skip re-renders for unchanged messages.
