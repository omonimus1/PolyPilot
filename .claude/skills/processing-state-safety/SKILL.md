# Processing State Safety

## When Clearing IsProcessing — The Checklist

Every code path that sets `IsProcessing = false` MUST also:
1. Clear `IsResumed = false`
2. Clear `HasUsedToolsThisTurn = false`
3. Clear `ActiveToolCallCount = 0`
4. Clear `ProcessingStartedAt = null`
5. Clear `ToolCallCount = 0`
6. Clear `ProcessingPhase = 0`
7. Clear `SendingFlag = 0` (prevents session deadlock on next send)
8. Call `ClearPermissionDenials()`
9. Call `FlushCurrentResponse(state)` BEFORE clearing IsProcessing
10. Fire `OnSessionComplete` (unblocks orchestrator loops waiting for completion)
11. Add a diagnostic log entry (`[COMPLETE]`, `[ERROR]`, `[ABORT]`, etc.)
12. Run on UI thread (via `InvokeOnUI()` or already on UI thread)
13. After changes, run `ProcessingWatchdogTests.cs` to catch regressions

## The 9 Paths That Clear IsProcessing

| # | Path | File | Thread | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CompleteResponse | Events.cs | UI (via Invoke) | Normal completion |
| 2 | SessionErrorEvent | Events.cs | Background → InvokeOnUI | SDK error |
| 3 | Watchdog timeout (kill) | Events.cs | Timer → InvokeOnUI | No events for 120s/600s, server dead, or max time exceeded (Case C) |
| 4 | Watchdog clean complete | Events.cs | Timer → InvokeOnUI | Tools done, lost terminal event → calls CompleteResponse (Case B, PR #332) |
| 5 | AbortSessionAsync (local) | CopilotService.cs | UI | User clicks Stop |
| 6 | AbortSessionAsync (remote) | CopilotService.cs | UI | Mobile stop |
| 7 | SendAsync reconnect failure | CopilotService.cs | UI | Prompt send failed after reconnect |
| 8 | SendAsync initial failure | CopilotService.cs | UI | Prompt send failed |
| 9 | Bridge OnTurnEnd | Bridge.cs | Background → InvokeOnUI | Remote mode turn complete |

## Content Persistence Safety

### Turn-End Flush
`FlushCurrentResponse` is called on `AssistantTurnEndEvent` to persist accumulated response text at each sub-turn boundary. Without this, response content between `assistant.turn_end` and `session.idle` is lost if the app restarts (the ReviewPRs bug — response content was lost on app restart).

### Dedup Guard on Resume
`FlushCurrentResponse` includes a dedup check: if the last non-tool assistant message in History has identical content, it skips the add and just clears `CurrentResponse`. This prevents duplicates when SDK replays events after session resume.

### ChatDatabase Resilience (PR #276)
`ChatDatabase` methods catch ALL exceptions (`catch (Exception ex)`) — not just specific types.
All 15 `_ = _chatDb.AddMessageAsync(...)` callers in CopilotService are fire-and-forget.
If the catch filter is too narrow, uncaught exceptions become **unobserved task exceptions**
that crash the app. The DB is a write-through cache; `events.jsonl` is the source of truth
and replays on session resume via `BulkInsertAsync`. DB write failures are self-healing.
**NEVER narrow the ChatDatabase catch filters** — use `catch (Exception ex)` always.

## 13 Invariants

### INV-1: Complete state cleanup
Every IsProcessing=false path clears ALL fields. See checklist above.

### INV-2: UI thread for mutations
ALL IsProcessing mutations go through UI thread via `InvokeOnUI()`.

### INV-3: ProcessingGeneration guard
Use generation guard before clearing IsProcessing. `SyncContext.Post` is
async — new `SendPromptAsync` can race between `Post()` and callback.

```csharp
// Capture BEFORE posting to UI thread
var gen = Interlocked.Read(ref state.ProcessingGeneration);
InvokeOnUI(() =>
{
    // Validate INSIDE the callback — abort if a new turn started
    if (Interlocked.Read(ref state.ProcessingGeneration) != gen) return;
    // Safe to clear IsProcessing here
});
```

### INV-4: No hardcoded short timeouts
NEVER add hardcoded short timeouts for session resume. The watchdog
(120s/600s) with tiered approach is the correct mechanism.

### INV-5: HasUsedToolsThisTurn > ActiveToolCallCount
`ActiveToolCallCount` alone is insufficient. `AssistantTurnStartEvent`
resets it between tool rounds. `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` persists.

### INV-6: IsResumed scoping
`IsResumed` scoped to mid-turn resumes (`isStillProcessing=true`).
Cleared on ALL termination paths. Extends watchdog to 600s.
Clearing guarded on `!hasActiveTool && !HasUsedToolsThisTurn`.

### INV-7: Volatile for cross-thread fields
When adding NEW cross-thread boolean/int flags, use `Volatile.Write`/`Volatile.Read`
for ARM weak memory model correctness. Existing fields `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` and
`HasReceivedEventsSinceResume` use plain assignment (pre-existing inconsistency —
tracked separately, do not fix inline). Do NOT introduce additional plain-assignment
cross-thread fields without a tracking comment explaining the gap.

### INV-8: No InvokeAsync in HandleComplete
`HandleComplete` is already on UI thread. `InvokeAsync` defers execution
causing stale renders.

### INV-9: Session restore must initialize all watchdog-dependent state
The restore path (`RestoreSingleSessionAsync`) is separate from `SendPromptAsync`.
Any field that affects watchdog timeout selection or dispatch routing must be
initialized in BOTH paths:
- `IsMultiAgentSession` — set via `IsSessionInMultiAgentGroup()` before `StartProcessingWatchdog`
- `HasReceivedEventsSinceResume` / `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` — set via `GetEventsFileRestoreHints()`
- `IsResumed` — set on the `AgentSessionInfo` when `isStillProcessing` is true

When `ReconcileOrganization` hasn't run yet (during `IsRestoring` window),
`Organization.Sessions` metadata may be stale. Any code that reads metadata
during this window must call `ReconcileOrganization(allowPruning: false)` first.
This additive mode safely adds missing entries without pruning loading sessions.

### INV-10: TurnEnd fallback must not be permanently suppressed (PR #332)
The `AssistantTurnEndEvent` 4s fallback → `CompleteResponse` guards against
premature firing during multi-tool sessions. **Do NOT** use `HasUsedToolsThisTurn`
to skip this fallback entirely — that permanently disables recovery for all
agent sessions and leaves them 100% dependent on `SessionIdleEvent`. If that
event is dropped (SDK bug #299), the session sticks for 600s.

**Correct approach**: Use `ActiveToolCallCount > 0` to skip the 4s fallback
(tools are still running). If tools are done (`ActiveToolCallCount == 0`) but
`HasUsedToolsThisTurn` is true, use an extended 30s delay
(`TurnEndIdleToolFallbackAdditionalMs = 30_000`). The cancellation token from
`AssistantTurnStartEvent` is the correct mechanism to prevent premature firing
when the LLM does multi-round tool use.

### INV-11: Watchdog must distinguish active tools from lost events (PR #332)
Blindly waiting the full 600s tool timeout when `ActiveToolCallCount == 0`
(tools finished) is wrong — the SDK may have silently dropped the terminal event
(`SessionIdleEvent`). The watchdog timeout path must use a 3-way branch:

- **Case A** (`hasActiveTool && server alive`): Probe `_serverManager.IsServerRunning()`
  (TCP port check). If alive → reset `LastEventAtTicks` and continue. If dead → fall through to kill.
- **Case B** (`!hasActiveTool && HasUsedToolsThisTurn && !exceededMaxTime`): Call
  `CompleteResponse` cleanly (no error message) then `break`. Lost terminal event scenario.
- **Case C** (default): Kill with "⚠️ Session appears stuck" error message. Max time
  exceeded, server dead, or something genuinely wrong.

This prevents the "10-minute kill" where tools ran successfully but the session
was murdered because the SDK dropped the follow-up `SessionIdleEvent`.

### INV-12: All background→UI dispatches must capture ProcessingGeneration (PR #332)
Any code that posts work to the UI thread from a background thread (watchdog loop,
`Task.Run`, timer callbacks) must:
1. Capture `var gen = Interlocked.Read(ref state.ProcessingGeneration)` **before** the `InvokeOnUI` call
2. Validate `if (Interlocked.Read(ref state.ProcessingGeneration) != gen) return;` **inside** the lambda

Without this guard, a stale watchdog tick (racing with abort+resend) can flush
content from a new turn into the old turn's history. Every Case B and Case C
watchdog callback has this guard; the periodic flush callback must too.

### INV-13: Use InvokeOnUI() (class method) in Task.Run closures (PR #332)
The local `Invoke(Action)` function inside `HandleSessionEvent` (declared at
line ~249) can have scoping ambiguity when captured by `Task.Run` closures.
Use the class-level `InvokeOnUI()` method in all `Task.Run` and timer callbacks
for explicit, unambiguous UI thread dispatch. The local `Invoke` works but the
intent is less clear when reading cross-threaded code.

## Top 5 Recurring Mistakes

1. **Incomplete cleanup** — modifying one IsProcessing path without
   updating ALL fields that must be cleared simultaneously.
2. **Suppressing the TurnEnd fallback for tool sessions** — using `HasUsedToolsThisTurn`
   to skip the fallback entirely leaves agent sessions with zero recovery when
   `SessionIdleEvent` is dropped. Use `ActiveToolCallCount` to guard and an
   extended delay for the tool-used case. (PR #332)
3. **Background thread mutations** — mutating IsProcessing or related
   state on SDK event threads instead of marshaling to UI thread.
4. **Missing content flush on turn boundaries** — `FlushCurrentResponse`
   must be called at every point where accumulated text could be lost
   (turn_end, tool_start, abort, error, watchdog). The turn_end call
   was missing until PR #224, causing response loss on app restart.
5. **Missing state initialization on session restore** — `IsMultiAgentSession`,
   `IsResumed`, and other flags must be set on restored sessions BEFORE
   `StartProcessingWatchdog` is called. The restore path in
   `RestoreSingleSessionAsync` is separate from `SendPromptAsync` and must
   independently initialize all state the watchdog depends on. PR #284 fixed
   `IsMultiAgentSession` not being set during restore, causing the watchdog
   to use 120s instead of 600s for multi-agent workers.

**Retired mistake (was #2):** *ActiveToolCallCount as sole tool signal* — still relevant per
INV-5, but the more impactful version is #2 above (suppressing the fallback entirely).

## Diagnosing a Stuck Session

When a session shows "Thinking..." indefinitely:

1. **Check the diagnostic log** — `~/.polypilot/event-diagnostics.log`
   ```bash
   grep 'SESSION_NAME' ~/.polypilot/event-diagnostics.log | tail -20
   ```
   Look for the last `[SEND]` (turn started) and whether `[IDLE]` or `[COMPLETE]` followed.

2. **Check if the watchdog is running** — look for `[WATCHDOG]` entries after the `[SEND]`.
   If none appear, the watchdog wasn't started (see INV-9 for restore path issues).

3. **Check `IsProcessing` state** — via MauiDevFlow CDP:
   ```bash
   maui-devflow cdp Runtime evaluate "document.querySelector('.processing-indicator')?.textContent"
   ```

4. **Common stuck patterns:**
   | Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
   |---------|-------------|-----|
   | `[SEND]` then silence | SDK never responded, watchdog will catch at 120s | Wait or abort |
   | `[EVT] TurnEnd` but no `[IDLE]` | Zero-idle SDK bug | Watchdog catches at 30s fallback (INV-10) |
   | `[COMPLETE]` fired but spinner persists | UI thread not notified | Check INV-2, INV-8 |
   | `[WATCHDOG]` clears but re-sticks | New turn started before watchdog callback ran | Check INV-3 generation guard |

5. **Nuclear option** — user clicks Stop (AbortSessionAsync, path #5/#6).
