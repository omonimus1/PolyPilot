# Processing State Safety

## When Clearing IsProcessing — The Checklist

Every code path that sets `IsProcessing = false` MUST also:
1. Clear `IsResumed = false`
2. Clear `HasUsedToolsThisTurn = false`
3. Clear `ActiveToolCallCount = 0`
4. Clear `ProcessingStartedAt = null`
5. Clear `ToolCallCount = 0`
6. Clear `ProcessingPhase = 0`
7. Call `FlushCurrentResponse(state)` BEFORE clearing IsProcessing
8. Add a diagnostic log entry (`[COMPLETE]`, `[ERROR]`, `[ABORT]`, etc.)
9. Run on UI thread (via `InvokeOnUI()` or already on UI thread)

## The 8 Paths That Clear IsProcessing

| # | Path | File | Thread | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CompleteResponse | Events.cs | UI (via Invoke) | Normal completion |
| 2 | SessionErrorEvent | Events.cs | Background → InvokeOnUI | SDK error |
| 3 | Watchdog timeout | Events.cs | Timer → InvokeOnUI | No events for 120s/600s |
| 4 | AbortSessionAsync (local) | CopilotService.cs | UI | User clicks Stop |
| 5 | AbortSessionAsync (remote) | CopilotService.cs | UI | Mobile stop |
| 6 | SendAsync reconnect failure | CopilotService.cs | UI | Prompt send failed after reconnect |
| 7 | SendAsync initial failure | CopilotService.cs | UI | Prompt send failed |
| 8 | Bridge OnTurnEnd | Bridge.cs | Background → InvokeOnUI | Remote mode turn complete |

## Content Persistence Safety

### Turn-End Flush
`FlushCurrentResponse` is called on `AssistantTurnEndEvent` to persist accumulated response text at each sub-turn boundary. Without this, response content between `assistant.turn_end` and `session.idle` is lost if the app restarts (the ReviewPRs bug — response content was lost on app restart).

### Dedup Guard on Resume
`FlushCurrentResponse` includes a dedup check: if the last non-tool assistant message in History has identical content, it skips the add and just clears `CurrentResponse`. This prevents duplicates when SDK replays events after session resume.

### ChatDatabase Resilience (PR #276)
`ChatDatabase` methods catch ALL exceptions (`catch (Exception ex)`) — not just specific types.
All 15 `_ = _chatDb.AddMessageAsync(...)` callers in CopilotService are fire-and-forget.
If the catch filter is too narrow, uncaught exceptions become **unobserved task exceptions**
that crash the app. The DB is a write-through cache; `events.jsonl` is the source of truth
and replays on session resume via `BulkInsertAsync`. DB write failures are self-healing.
**NEVER narrow the ChatDatabase catch filters** — use `catch (Exception ex)` always.

## 9 Invariants

### INV-1: Complete state cleanup
Every IsProcessing=false path clears ALL fields. See checklist above.

### INV-2: UI thread for mutations
ALL IsProcessing mutations go through UI thread via `InvokeOnUI()`.

### INV-3: ProcessingGeneration guard
Use generation guard before clearing IsProcessing. `SyncContext.Post` is
async — new `SendPromptAsync` can race between `Post()` and callback.

### INV-4: No hardcoded short timeouts
NEVER add hardcoded short timeouts for session resume. The watchdog
(120s/600s) with tiered approach is the correct mechanism.

### INV-5: HasUsedToolsThisTurn > ActiveToolCallCount
`ActiveToolCallCount` alone is insufficient. `AssistantTurnStartEvent`
resets it between tool rounds. `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` persists.

### INV-6: IsResumed scoping
`IsResumed` scoped to mid-turn resumes (`isStillProcessing=true`).
Cleared on ALL termination paths. Extends watchdog to 600s.
Clearing guarded on `!hasActiveTool && !HasUsedToolsThisTurn`.

### INV-7: Volatile for cross-thread fields
`HasUsedToolsThisTurn`, `HasReceivedEventsSinceResume` should use
`Volatile.Write`/`Volatile.Read`. ARM weak memory model issue.
(Currently partial — resets use plain assignment.)

### INV-8: No InvokeAsync in HandleComplete
`HandleComplete` is already on UI thread. `InvokeAsync` defers execution
causing stale renders.

### INV-9: Session restore must initialize all watchdog-dependent state
The restore path (`RestoreSingleSessionAsync`) is separate from `SendPromptAsync`.
Any field that affects watchdog timeout selection or dispatch routing must be
initialized in BOTH paths:
- `IsMultiAgentSession` — set via `IsSessionInMultiAgentGroup()` before `StartProcessingWatchdog`
- `HasReceivedEventsSinceResume` / `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` — set via `GetEventsFileRestoreHints()`
- `IsResumed` — set on the `AgentSessionInfo` when `isStillProcessing` is true

When `ReconcileOrganization` hasn't run yet (during `IsRestoring` window),
`Organization.Sessions` metadata may be stale. Any code that reads metadata
during this window must call `ReconcileOrganization(allowPruning: false)` first.
This additive mode safely adds missing entries without pruning loading sessions.

## Top 5 Recurring Mistakes

1. **Incomplete cleanup** — modifying one IsProcessing path without
   updating ALL fields that must be cleared simultaneously.
2. **ActiveToolCallCount as sole tool signal** — gets reset/skipped
   in several paths; always check `HasUsedToolsThisTurn` too.
3. **Background thread mutations** — mutating IsProcessing or related
   state on SDK event threads instead of marshaling to UI thread.
4. **Missing content flush on turn boundaries** — `FlushCurrentResponse`
   must be called at every point where accumulated text could be lost
   (turn_end, tool_start, abort, error, watchdog). The turn_end call
   was missing until PR #224, causing response loss on app restart.
5. **Missing state initialization on session restore** — `IsMultiAgentSession`,
   `IsResumed`, and other flags must be set on restored sessions BEFORE
   `StartProcessingWatchdog` is called. The restore path in
   `RestoreSingleSessionAsync` is separate from `SendPromptAsync` and must
   independently initialize all state the watchdog depends on. PR #284 fixed
   `IsMultiAgentSession` not being set during restore, causing the watchdog
   to use 120s instead of 600s for multi-agent workers.
